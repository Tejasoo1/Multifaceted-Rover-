This repository consists of all the information related to my fourth year final project, Multifaceted Rover:-


Abstract:-
Technology is being rapidly advancing over a time and there is an inflated demand for this booming technology, 
when it comes to technological products like Robots, designing and fabricating an advance robot with more and
more features is bit difficult task and needs a lots of investment, so How to deal with it? Well, if you have 
such an issue then this paper explains you/gives you a brief idea on how to build your own advance robot in 
an easiest way and in most economical passion. This paper aims to discuss about various new systems developed 
to create a multi-functional rover & also proposes design ideas in order to integrate these systems to the rover.
Here the analysis of previous systems developed by other people is done & a new solution is proposed to improve 
these systems in order to make rover multi-functional. These systems mainly are 6 DOF robotic arm control system,
rover maneuvering system controlled by a Web-Socket webpage which is also capable of doing live video streaming, 
sensors control system. This paper most importantly focuses on the coding part developed to control the 6 DOF 
robotic arm with PCA-9685 servo shield using Node-MCU controller, the code for which was never developed previously.
It also focuses on the overall merged code developed for controlling the sensor system consisting of three sensors.
